Name Counter
Input alphabet is start
Output alphabet is done
Input pointers are default
Output pointers are default
Variables are
	int count = 0
	int limit = 5
States are
	Init: []
	Counting: [count = count + 1; output count to default]
	Done: [output done to default]
Transitions are
	Init-[got start from default]->Counting
	Counting-[timeout 1000]->Counting
	Counting-[count == limit]->Done
Thanks
